  "New South Wales": "New South Wales, the most populous state with Sydney as its vibrant capital, is facing an aging population trend, but at a slightly slower pace than Victoria or Queensland. The state's fertility rate has been declining since 2013, but the percentage of residents aged 60 and over has steadily risen, reaching 23% by 2024. Despite a higher overall population size, New South Wales has witnessed a similar trend in healthcare worker numbers and their proportion to total employment, highlighting the need for proactive planning and resource allocation to meet the growing needs of its older residents.",
  "Victoria": "Victoria, with its bustling city of Melbourne, faces a steadily aging population. While fertility rates have been declining since 2013, the percentage of residents aged 60 and over has risen consistently, reaching 22% by 2024. This aging trend is mirrored by a growing need for healthcare services. The proportion of healthcare workers to total employment in the state has climbed steadily, reflecting the increasing demand. Victoria needs to address the challenges of an aging population, including healthcare infrastructure and workforce planning, to ensure the well-being of its older residents.",
  "Queensland": "Queensland, with its sunny climate and coastal lifestyle, is experiencing a complex aging population dynamic. While the state boasts a relatively higher fertility rate compared to other states, the percentage of residents aged 60 and over is also steadily increasing, reaching 23% by 2024. This indicates that despite a higher birth rate, the population is aging due to factors like increased life expectancy and migration patterns. Queensland's healthcare system needs to be prepared to accommodate the growing number of older residents, requiring investment in infrastructure and healthcare workers.",
  "South Australia": "South Australia, with its capital Adelaide, stands out as a state with a more pronounced aging population. It has experienced a consistent decline in fertility rates since 2013, coupled with a notably rapid increase in the percentage of residents aged 60 and over. By 2024, this figure reached 26%, the highest among all Australian states. South Australia's aging population presents significant challenges for its healthcare system, demanding strategic investments in infrastructure, staffing, and service delivery models.",
  "Western Australia": "Western Australia, home to the city of Perth and vast mineral resources, is experiencing an aging population at a pace comparable to New South Wales. While the state's fertility rate has been relatively stable, the percentage of residents aged 60 and over has increased steadily, reaching 22% by 2024. Western Australia faces the challenge of ensuring its healthcare system can cater to its aging population, including prioritizing healthcare infrastructure development and attracting and retaining healthcare professionals.",
  "Tasmania": "Tasmania, known for its rugged beauty and island charm, stands out as the state with the highest percentage of residents aged 60 and over, reaching 29% by 2024. The state has experienced a consistent decline in fertility rates since 2013, contributing to this trend. Tasmania's aging population poses significant challenges for its healthcare system, necessitating a focused approach to address the unique needs of its older residents, including healthcare access, long-term care, and social support services.",
  "Northern Territory": "The Northern Territory, with its diverse landscapes and remote communities, has a significantly younger population compared to other states. The state's fertility rate has remained consistently higher, and the percentage of residents aged 60 and over has remained relatively low, reaching 14% by 2024. Despite its younger demographic, the Northern Territory's healthcare system faces challenges related to geographical isolation and access to services, which may become more pronounced as its population ages.",
  "Australian Capital Territory": "The Australian Capital Territory (ACT), home to Canberra, is experiencing an aging population but at a slower pace compared to other states. While the fertility rate has been fluctuating, the percentage of residents aged 60 and over has risen steadily, reaching 18% by 2024. The ACT faces the challenge of balancing its relatively young population with the increasing need for healthcare services for older residents.",
  "Australia": "The worldâ€™s population is ageing, and Australia is no exception. <strong>This interactive map is designed to help school students understand the seriousness of Australia's ageing population trends</strong>. By exploring this page, students can <strong>interact with the line chart with selected indicators</strong> to see how old the Australia's population is, or <strong>click and zoom</strong> into each state on the map and see detailed visualisations of demographic changes over the years. The subplots reveal the state's population pyramids, fertility rates, and the trends in the percentage of the 60+ age group, as well as the employment trends of health care workers.<br><br>In the coming decades, many countries, including Australia, are likely to face significant fiscal and political pressures related to public health care systems, pensions, and social protections for a growing older population. Australia's ageing trend is accelerating rapidly. By 2026, more than 22 percent of Australians will be aged over 65, up from 16 percent in 2020, which was already double the 8.3 percent at the start of the 1970s.<br><br>We intentionally selected 2 countries to compare with Australia: India, a young and rising country; Japan, a developed one but haunted with population ageing issue. As the line chart shows, Australia is right in between them, alerting Government to take mitigation measures right away.<br><br>These visualisations highlight that while the number of health care workers is increasing, it may not be sufficient to meet the demands of an ageing population. Understanding these trends is crucial for planning and preparing for the future, ensuring that Australia can provide adequate care and support for its elderly population.<br><br><br><br><br><br><font color=\"red\"><strong>Data sources</strong>:</font><br><strong>Population related statistics</strong>: <br>https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population<br>https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL<br>    <strong>Employment related statistics</strong>:<br> https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/income-and-work/industry-employment-indp"
